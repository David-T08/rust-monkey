# Monkey in Rust
An implementation of the Monkey interpreted programming language using Rust

## About
This is my first ever real Rust project, I'm using it as a way to get familiar and comfortable with the language. I expect to add a bytecode compiler and lasty a virtual machine to run the bytecode. The project is based on the book "Writing an Interpreter in Go" by Thorsten Ball.

## Resources:
